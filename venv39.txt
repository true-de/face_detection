### 🛠 Steps

#### 1. **Install Python 3.9** (if not already installed)

On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-venv python3.9-dev
```

#### 2. **Create a new virtual environment using Python 3.9**

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/face_detection
python3.9 -m venv venv39
source venv39/bin/activate
```

You should now see `(venv39)` in your prompt.

#### 3. **Reinstall the packages**

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install dlib
pip install git+https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition_models
pip install face_recognition
```

sudo apt-get install python3-tk

#### 4. **Try running your script again**

```bash
face_recognition known/elon.jpeg unknown/download.jpeg
```

### 🔍 What’s going wrong?

Your virtual environment was likely created using a Python binary **that doesn’t have access to `tkinter`**, even though it’s installed system-wide.

This can happen if:

* You created the venv using a custom Python version.
* The venv was created before installing `python3-tk`.

### 🛠️ Fix Options

#### ✅ Option 1: Recreate the virtual environment using the system Python (now with tkinter)

Run these commands:

```bash
# First, deactivate and remove old venv
deactivate
rm -rf venv39
